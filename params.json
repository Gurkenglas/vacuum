Those graphs may then be further\r\nprocessed or translated to various representations for visualization\r\n-- like Graphviz, or Ubigraph.\r\n\r\n[travis-ci.org](http://travis-ci.org) results: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thoughtpolice/vacuum.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/thoughtpolice/vacuum)\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nIt's just a `cabal install` away on [Hackage][]:\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n$ cabal install vacuum\r\n# also install the graphviz package, for SVG/PNG rendering:\r\n$ cabal install vacuum-graphviz\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n# Gallery of examples\r\n\r\nWant to try before you buy, and see what Vacuum output looks like?\r\nHere are some examples:\r\n\r\n * Vacuuming the linked list `[1, 2]` - [Results][e1]\r\n\r\nMore examples will come in the future.\r\n\r\n# Join in\r\n\r\nFile bugs in the GitHub [issue tracker][].\r\n\r\nMaster [git repository][gh]:\r\n\r\n * `git clone https://github.com/thoughtpolice/vacuum.git`\r\n\r\nThere's also a [BitBucket mirror][bb]:\r\n\r\n * `git clone https://bitbucket.org/thoughtpolice/vacuum.git`\r\n\r\n# Authors\r\n\r\nSee [AUTHORS.txt](https://raw.github.com/thoughtpolice/vacuum/master/AUTHORS.txt).\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nLGPLv3.
