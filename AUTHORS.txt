Vacuum was originally written in 2009 by Matt Morrow. Matt has since
disappeared and with it, the original darcs repository holding his
code and changeset history.

Austin Seipp (mad.one -at- gmail.com) is the current
maintainer.

Various people have contributed to vacuum over the years; the
following list is in no order, and is in no way comprehensive. If
